# Developer setup

- Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to build the project and watch for changes. The locally accessible address will be displayed in the command terminal.

# Tests

- Run `npm test` to execute the tests.

# Production

- Run `npm run build` to create a production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Assumptions

- Validation. I put an upper limit on the inputs for 100 characters. This wasn't specified in the brief. In a real world situation I would speak to the relevant people in my team, either product/design and/or backend developer.
